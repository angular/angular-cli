## The Goal of DevKit

Our goal is to provide a large set of libraries that can be used to manage, develop, deploy and
analyze your code.

This is the extension of the Angular CLI Project. Once this set of tools is done, the Angular CLI
as it is today will become one of many interfaces available to perform those tasks. Everything
will also be available to third party tools and IDEs.
