about: Something is broken in Angular Universal

<--
Please follow the below issue template. Issues not following the issue template will be closed.
Please provide _as much detail as possible_ in as minimal a reproduction as possible. This means no/only one third-party
libraries, no application-specific code, etc. Essentially, we're looking for an `ng new` project with maybe one
additional file/change. If this is not possible, please look deeper into your issue or post it to StackOverflow 
for support. This is a bug/feature tracker, meaning that something is actively _missing or broken_ in Angular Universal.
Anything else does not belong on this forum.

For very common issues when using Angular Universal, please see [this doc](docs/gotchas.md). This includes
issues for `window is not defined` and other hiccups when adopting Angular Universal for the first time.
