## Yarn Workspaces

The package architecture of `angular-cli` repository is originally setup using
yarn [workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/). This means the
dependencies of various `package.json` in the repository are linked and
installed together.

## Bazel

Since then, Bazel was introduced to manage some of the build dependencies in
`angular-cli` repo. However, Bazel does **not** yet support yarn workspaces,
since it requires laying out more than one `node_modules` directory. In this
mixed mode, developers ought to take extra care to synchronize the dependencies.

Since the `yarn_install` rule that installs all NPM dependencies in this
repository only reads from the **root** `package.json`, every Bazel target that
depends on packages downloaded from the NPM registry will need to have the
dependency declared in the **root** `package.json`.

In addition, if the dependency is also needed at runtime (non-dev dependencies),
the dependency on the individual package's `package.json` has to be updated as
well. This is to ensure that when users download a published version from NPM,
they will be able to install all dependencies correctly without Bazel. It is the
responsibility of the developer to keep both `package.json` in sync.

## Windows support

In general, any sort of node file lookup on Bazel should be subject to `require.resolve`.
This is how rules_nodejs resolves paths using the Bazel runfiles mechanism, where a given
Bazel target only has access to outputs from its dependencies.

In practice, this does not make a lot of difference on Linux.
A symlink forest is laid down where the target is going to actually run, and mostly the
files are resolved correctly whether you use `require.resolve` or not because the files are there.

On Windows though, that's a stricter. Bazel does not lay down a symlink forest on
windows by default. If you don't use `require.resolve`, it's still possible to correctly
resolve some files, like outputs from other rules. But other files, like node modules
dependencies and data files, need to be looked up in the runfiles.

Since the requirement is quite lax on Linux but quite strict on windows, what ends up
happening is that lack of `require.resolve` calls go unnoticed until someone tries to run
things on Windows, at which point it breaks.

## Debugging jasmine_node_test

On Linux, Bazel tests will run under a sandbox for isolation.
You can turn off this sandbox by adding the [`local = True`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/common-definitions.html#common-attributes-tests) attribute to the rule.
You can also force local execution by passing `--test_output=streamed`.

Then you will find the intermediate test files in `bazel-out/k8-fastbuild/bin`, followed by the test target path.

Tests that are sharded, via the `shard_count` attribute, can fail if you reduce the number of tests or focus only a few.
This will cause some shards to execute 0 tests, which makes the exit with an error code.

Tests that are marked as flaky, via the `flaky` attribute, will repeat when they fail.
This will cause any focused test to be repeated multiple time, since the presence of focused tests
causes jasmine to exit with a non-zero exit code.

While testing, you can remove the `shard_count` attribute to prevent sharding and the `flaky`
attribute to prevent repetition.
Setting `--test_output=streamed` will disable sharding and `--flaky_test_attempts=1` will disable
the reruns of tests that have been marked as `flaky`.

The `.bazelrc` includes a config for running tests with remote debugging enabled:

```sh
yarn bazel test --config=debug //packages/angular/cli:angular-cli_test
# Also disable reruns of failing tests that were marked as flaky:
yarn bazel test --config=debug --config=no-sharding //packages/angular/cli:angular-cli_test
```

NB: For a few tests, sandbox is required as otherwise the rules_nodejs linker symlinks will conflict
with the yarn workspace symlinks in node_modules.

## Issues
