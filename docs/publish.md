#Change versions
- There is a main `package.json` which should keep with the latest universal-cli version (e.g. `1.0.0-beta.17`).
- There is one `package.json` per packages. Update the version of every packages independently.
- Run the CHANGELOG script.
  - `node ./scripts/publish/changelog.js OLD_VERSION_TAG`
  - (for example, `v1.0.0-beta.17`)
- Create a commit. The commit message should be only the version number starting with a v.
- Create a tag. The tag should be only the version number starting with a v.
- Push to upstream with tags.
  - `git push master`
  - `git push --tags`
- Publish to npm
  - `npm run build`
  - `cd ./dist/universal-cli`
  - `npm publish --tag experimental` (install it with `npm install -g universal-cli@experimental` and test it)
  - `npm publish` (the new version is now available at npm)
